{"name":"Angajime.GitHub.io","tagline":"My very own personal website","body":"### Welcome to my website.\r\nMy name is Antonio García Jiménez. I'm a last-year student at Universidad de Málaga on Computer Science. This is my personal website and I will try to keep a nice place where I gather all my experiences and likes. This site is made using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and its [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) which is pretty awesome.\r\n\r\n### Current projects\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### My job\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Useful stuff\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
